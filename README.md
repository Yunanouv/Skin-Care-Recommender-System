Nowadays, skin care is becoming one of the most essential things in our lives. Skincare products have grown rapidly everywhere and tend to increase year by year. So do not be surprised if there are so many skin care products circulating in the community. However, the large number of product choices makes it difficult for people to choose the product that best suits their facial needs. Therefore, the author took the initiative to create a system that is able to recommend skin care products based on facial skin problems. In this study, the author uses the method of content-based filtering in making the recommendation system. This recommendation system is made without using rating data, so the algorithm approach used is cosine similarity and TF-IDF in finding similarity features. Then, the first output that appears will be used by the machine as historical data to then enter the content-based filtering stage. So, users will get recommendations according to the selected keywords and similar products.
